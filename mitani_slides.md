Highlights from my review
========================================================
### Strength
* Possess necessary qualifications and experience in the proposed area of
research
* Good publication record
* Excellent mentoring team and training environment
* Strong letters of support
* ``Given the paucity of biostatisticians with expertise and experience in analysis of dental data, the training of the
next generation of biostatisticians with this knowledge should be a top priority"

### Weakness
* Data was from the VA so only men were included in the analysis
* Insufficient information on Protection of Human Subjects
  + Inclusion of Women Plan was unacceptable 
  + Inclusion of Children Plan was unacceptable
 


To do
========================================================

### Notify your intention to:
  + Primary advisor
  + Department chair
  + Department grant manager
  + Department financial manager
  
### eRA Commons
  + Create an account
  + Change your status to ``principal investigator"
  + Change your sponsor's status to ``sponsor"


Random tips
========================================================
* Take every section seriously
* Understand your competition
  + Look up F31 success rate by institution (https://report.nih.gov/funding/nih-budget-and-spending-data-past-fiscal-years/success-rates)
  + Look for similar grant proposals (https://projectreporter.nih.gov/reporter.cfm)
* If your school offers RCR training, wait to take it after you are awarded
